# Config for My TouchBar My Rules 

Once upon a time, I was constantly frustrated with the limited functionality of my MacBook's Touchbar. I wanted to have more control over my media, have quick access to important information like weather and CPU usage, and be able to easily switch between different modes like "Do Not Disturb" and "Day/Night" mode.

So, I decided to create my own Touchbar configuration tool called My Touchbar My Rules, or [MTMR]((https://github.com/Toxblh/MTMR)) for short. I spent countless hours tinkering and experimenting until I finally had a setup that suited all of my needs.

With MTMR, I was able to control media playback directly from the Touchbar, easily switch between different currencies, and view important information like weather, CPU usage, and network activity at a glance. I also included a "Do Not Disturb" mode that automatically silences notifications and a "Day/Night" mode that adjusts the brightness and color of my screen based on the time of day.

In addition, I added a countdown timer for the popular "pomodoro" productivity technique and a quick button to easily kill any application that was causing trouble. And, of course, I made sure to include the current battery percentage, date, time (in 12H format), and AM/PM indicator.

With MTMR, I also included a quick button that allowed me to easily close any application that was causing trouble or that I no longer needed. This saved me a lot of time and hassle and made using my MacBook even more efficient. With this feature, I could easily switch between different applications and close the ones that were not in use anymore with just one click from the touchbar.

I finally had a Touchbar configuration that was tailored to my specific needs and made using my MacBook a much more enjoyable and efficient experience. And I lived happily ever after.
